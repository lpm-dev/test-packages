# test-packages

Local live/smoke fixtures for manual `lpm` testing.

## Runner

Use `python3 run_smokes.py --list` to see the available scenarios.

Use `python3 run_smokes.py all` to rebuild `lpm-rs`, reset the relevant fixtures,
and run the current live smoke suite end to end.

The runner is Python on purpose: it uses the standard-library PTY support to
drive real interactive `lpm add` prompts without adding project dependencies.

## Layout

- `install/` — single-project fixtures for `lpm install`, `lpm add`, `lpm uninstall`, and related flows.
- `workspace/` — multi-package fixtures for workspace commands and workspace-specific behaviors.

## Notes

- This folder is the unified home for local end-to-end and live smoke fixtures.
- `lpm-test-packages/` remains for package publishing inputs and source-package authoring fixtures, not consumer-side E2E runs.
- Fixtures here should stay scrubbed of generated state unless a specific smoke case needs committed lockfiles or caches.
- Registry-backed smoke scenarios use an isolated `LPM_HOME` per run so repeated runs do not reuse stale packument or tarball cache entries.
